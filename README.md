# UMD Libraries Design System

A comprehensive design system research project that establishes the foundation for University of Maryland Libraries' Drupal theme development. This project implements an opinionated design system specifically tailored for UMD Libraries' digital presence using Storybook as a component visualization and documentation platform.

## Purpose

This design system serves as a centralized source of truth for UMD Libraries' visual language, component patterns, and design guidelines. It ensures consistency across our digital platforms while streamlining the development process for our Drupal-based web presence.
